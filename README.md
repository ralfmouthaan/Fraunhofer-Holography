# Fraunhofer Holography

Holography has a long and storied past dating back to Gabor in 1951. Recently, computer-generated holograms have become incredibly widely used in applications such as telecoms, additive manufacture and optical trapping. Holography is currently drawing a lot of attention as it promises to eliminate the vergence-accommodation conflict problem in 3D augment reality and virtual reality systems. 

A wide range of algorithms is now available for generating holograms, with more algorithms being constantly proposed as well as improvements to existing algorithms. While authors regularly compare their algorithms to stalwarts such as the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, it is often unclear how more modern algorithms compare to each other. This work aims to implement current algorithms and benchmark them against each other. This will provide insights into the relative advantages of commonly used algorithms, as well as providing an archive of implementations.

In the first instance the most commonly used algorithms will be considered. These will be tested on a handful of carefully selected images using a few commonly used metrics. For the time being only 2D Fraunhofer holograms will be considered. Various spatial light modulator constraints will be considered though, including multi-level phase modulators, binary phase modulators and amplitude modulators.
